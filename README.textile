h1. What

This is the Mac OSX (x86-32) driver for the "IntellaSys FORTHdrive":http://www.intellasys.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=77 thumb stick evaluation board. The FORTHdrive houses a SEAforth24 CPU (24-core) as well as a 1GiB flash disk with the VentureForth development kit.

The Forth side of the driver is also included (USBdriveMX.f), although it will hardly be of use to anyone but me until "SwiftForth":http://www.forth.com for Mac OSX is finally released.

h1. How

* Build the driver, e.g. xcodebuild -configuration Debug

* Unplug your FORTHdrive

* Save your work in case the kernel crashes!

* Run 'sudo ./load.sh' to load the driver

* Plug in the FORTHdrive

* Run 'ioreg|grep wagerlabs' to verify that the driver is present

* Use USBdriveMX.f as a template for your gforth or other Forth implementation

h1. What not

* I haven't bothered with the sense buffer. Is it really needed? The Forth code does not seem to make use of it.

* Proper data is fed to the driver but something else is passed down to the FORTHdrive. I'm trying to figure out why. 

* I haven't dealt with reading data from the thumb stick yet. The Forth code in USBdrive>[x] is likely wrong, same for the driver code in SEAforth24.cpp.

* The driver is lacking polish :-).

h1. Finally

Use 'sudo kextunload -b com.wagerlabs.driver.SEAforth24' to force unloading of the driver, or simply take the FORTHdrive out and wait 1-2 minutes for the driver to unload automatically.
